# Deep Learning Image Colorization
Image Colorization by Deep Neural Networks is a challenging problem that is actively researched. The project included building a Deep Neural Network with associated data pipelines and applying state of the art image colorization techniques and comparing them with more classic deep learning approaches based on regression. Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both. Results aligned with earlier works in the field was found.
